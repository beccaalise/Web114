        <h3>Q: When would you use a switch statement in your projects?</h3>
        <p>
          A: A <code>switch</code> statement is useful when you need to evaluate a single variable against multiple potential values. 
          It makes your code cleaner and more organized than using multiple if-else-if conditions. For example, you might use it to respond differently based on the day of the week a user enters.
